# Showcase Generation

## Planning Phase (Required Before Generation)

Before generating any showcase content, complete this planning phase to ensure
depth and coverage.
This prevents the "breadth without depth" failure mode of autonomous generation.

### Step 1: Discover Available Content

Query Basic Memory for source material:

```text
1. Search for multi-session arcs: search_notes(query="multi-session arc")
2. List arc notes: build_context(url="memory://journal/arcs/*")
3. Check session notes: recent_activity(timeframe="30d")
```

### Step 2: Inventory Case Study Candidates

Create a candidate list with selection criteria:

| Arc | Sessions | Exchanges | Pattern | Showcase Value |
| --- | -------- | --------- | ------- | -------------- |
| {name} | {count} | {total} | {pattern} | High/Medium/Low |

**Showcase value criteria:**

- **High**:
  Multiple sessions, clear narrative arc, demonstrates skill/command usage,
  contains pivots or insights
- **Medium**:
  Useful pattern, fewer sessions, less dramatic arc
- **Low**:
  Routine work, minimal learning content

### Step 3: Plan Reference Depth

Decide which items get full-depth (100-200 lines) vs summary (30-60 lines):

| Category | Full Depth | Summary | Skip |
| -------- | ---------- | ------- | ---- |
| Rules | Core workflow rules | Utility rules | - |
| Skills | Top 6-8 most used | Domain-specific | Rarely used |
| Agents | Ralph loop agents | Utility agents | Experimental |
| Hooks | Core hooks | Simple wrappers | - |
| Commands | /brainstorm, /ralph, /dive | Utility commands | - |

### Step 4: Identify Emergent Insights

Before writing, identify insights that require dialogue to surface:

- What patterns emerged across multiple arcs?
- What "bootstrap" moments changed the configuration?
- What named concepts exist (e.g., "The Iron Law", "Bootstrap Pattern")?
- What trade-offs were consciously chosen?

**If running autonomously:** Flag these for later interactive enrichment rather
than inventing generic content.

### Step 5: Create Content Plan

Output a content plan before generating files:

```markdown
## Content Plan

### Case Studies (prioritized)
1. {name} - {why high value} - Full treatment
2. {name} - {why medium value} - Standard treatment
3. {name} - Skip or brief mention

### Reference Sections
- Rules: Full depth for {list}, summary for {list}
- Skills: Full depth for {list}, summary for {list}
- etc.

### Identified Gaps
- Need interactive session to surface: {topic}
- Missing source material for: {topic}
```

## Perspective: First-Person from Matt's POV

All showcase content is written from **Matt's perspective as the developer** who
configured this system.
The AI is a tool he uses, not the narrator.

### Correct Framing

| Context | Correct | Incorrect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Describing a skill | "I use this skill to ensure the AI writes tests first" | "I invoke this skill to prevent my most common failure mode" |
| Describing a rule | "This rule prevents the AI from committing without my permission" | "I never commit without explicit authorization" |
| Describing a hook | "This hook catches lint errors before I see the AI's output" | "This hook ensures I fix lint errors" |
| Describing an agent | "I dispatch this agent when I need focused code review" | "I review code when the user asks" |

### Key Distinction

- **"I"** = Matt (the developer who configured the system)
- **"The AI"** or **"the agent"** = the AI assistant being configured
- **"The skill/rule/hook"** = configuration that shapes AI behavior

## Prose Style

**Matter-of-fact prose only.** No humanizing the system, no evaluative language.

| Avoid | Use Instead |
| --- | --- |
| "amazing", "inspiring", "incredible" | (just describe what it does) |
| "This elegant solution..." | "This approach..." |
| "The AI brilliantly handles..." | "The AI handles..." |
| "greatly improved", "much better" | Specific measurable claims or nothing |

## Voice and Depth

### Personal Voice vs Generic Explanation

Interactive sessions produce content with Matt's specific voice and insights.
Autonomous generation tends toward generic explanations.

**Interactive voice (preferred):**

> "I use the Basic Memory MCP to keep a living knowledge base of my work, as I
> work."
>
> "Have the AI modify its config every time it does something 'wrong'. It will
> get better at doing what you actually want faster than you think."

**Generic voice (avoid in philosophy/overview docs):**

> "The agent should never perform destructive operations without explicit
> permission."
>
> "Basic Memory provides persistent knowledge storage."

### When to Flag for Interactive Enrichment

Mark sections that need dialogue to surface authentic voice:

```markdown
<!-- TODO: Interactive enrichment needed -->
<!-- This section explains the mechanism but lacks Matt's specific insights -->
<!-- about why he chose this approach or what he learned from using it -->
```

### Depth Indicators

Full-depth annotations should include these personal elements:

- **"Why I created this"** - The specific problem, not a generic use case
- **Named patterns** - If Matt has a name for it ("The Bootstrap Pattern", "The
  Iron Law"), use it
- **Trade-off rationale** - Why this choice over alternatives, from experience
- **Evolution notes** - How this changed over time based on usage

### Emergent Insights to Capture

These insights only surface through extended dialogue:

- Bootstrap moments:
  "When I first started, I did X.
  Now I do Y because..."
- Named concepts:
  Patterns Matt has named and uses repeatedly
- Cross-cutting learnings:
  Insights that apply across multiple arcs
- Counter-intuitive discoveries:
  Things that worked differently than expected

**If autonomous:** Note that these are missing rather than inventing
placeholders.

## Model Names

Use consistent model identifiers (as they appear in agent frontmatter):

| Correct | Incorrect |
| --- | --- |
| `sonnet4.5` | `claude-3-5-sonnet`, `sonnet-4.5`, `claude-sonnet` |
| `opus4.5` | `opus-4.5`, `claude-opus` |
| `haiku4.5` | `haiku-4.5`, `claude-haiku` |

**Avoid `inherit`** - every agent should explicitly declare its model.
`inherit` creates unpredictable behavior when the user's selected model doesn't
match the agent's capability requirements.

## Design Philosophy

**Experimentation is encouraged.** It's fine to create agents proactively and
see how often they get used (explicitly or auto-selected by Augment).
Low-use agents can be refined, merged, or removed.
Low-cost experimentation beats over-planning.

## Case Study Structure

Case studies use a three-part folder (README.md narrative, arc.md metadata,
sessions/ files). **See `REFERENCE.md` ("Case Study Structure") for the folder
layout and the full README/arc.md/session sub-templates.**

## Markdownlint Patterns

**See `REFERENCE.md` ("Markdownlint Quick Reference") for the MD028 / MD025 /
MD032 / MD013 / MD041 patterns and their fixes.**

## Content Sourcing

Pull case study content from Basic Memory:

1. **Arc notes**:
   `journal/arcs/multi-session-arc-{name}`
2. **Session notes**:
   `journal/sessions/YYYY/MM/{session-name}`
3. **Learning notes**:
   `learnings/{topic}`

Include actual quotes and specific details from these sources rather than
generic summaries.

## File Types

Annotations come in two depths: full-depth (100-200 lines) for core workflow
items and summary (30-50 lines) for less critical items. **See `REFERENCE.md`
for the complete full-depth and summary annotation templates with the section
breakdowns.**

## Reference Content

See `REFERENCE.md` for detailed patterns:

- Markdownlint patterns and fixes
- Directory structure
- Source link mapping
- Full-depth and summary annotation templates
- Execution modes (autonomous vs interactive)
