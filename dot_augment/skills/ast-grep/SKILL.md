# ast-grep Code Search

## Overview

This skill helps translate natural language queries into ast-grep rules for
structural code search.
ast-grep uses Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) patterns to match code based on its
structure rather than just text, enabling powerful and precise code search
across large codebases.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when users:

- Need to search for code patterns using structural matching (e.g., "find all
  async functions that don't have error handling")
- Want to locate specific language constructs (e.g., "find all function calls
  with specific parameters")
- Request searches that require understanding code structure rather than just
  text
- Ask to search for code with particular AST characteristics
- Need to perform complex code queries that traditional text search cannot
  handle

## General Workflow

Follow this process to help users write effective ast-grep rules:

### Step 1: Understand the Query

Clearly understand what the user wants to find.
Ask clarifying questions if needed:

- What specific code pattern or structure are they looking for?
- Which programming language?
- Are there specific edge cases or variations to consider?
- What should be included or excluded from matches?

### Step 2: Create Example Code

Write a simple code snippet that represents what the user wants to match.
Save this to a temporary file for testing.

**Example:** If searching for "async functions that use await", create a test
file:

```javascript
// test_example.js
async function example() {
  const result = await fetchData();
  return result;
}
```

### Step 3: Write the ast-grep Rule

Translate the pattern into an ast-grep rule.
Start simple and add complexity as needed.

**Key principles:**

- Always use `stopBy:
  end` for relational rules (`inside`, `has`) to ensure search goes to the end
  of the direction
- Use `pattern` for simple structures
- Use `kind` with `has`/`inside` for complex structures
- Break complex queries into smaller sub-rules using `all`, `any`, or `not`

**Example rule file (test_rule.yml):**

```yaml
id: async-with-await
language: javascript
rule:
  kind: function_declaration
  has:
    pattern: await $EXPR
    stopBy: end
```

See `references/rule_reference.md` for comprehensive rule documentation.

### Step 4: Test the Rule

Use ast-grep CLI to verify the rule matches the example code.
There are two main approaches:

**Option A:
Test with inline rules (for quick iterations)**

```bash
echo "async function test() { await fetch(); }" | ast-grep scan --inline-rules "id: test
language: javascript
rule:
  kind: function_declaration
  has:
    pattern: await \$EXPR
    stopBy: end" --stdin
```

**Option B:
Test with rule files (recommended for complex rules)**

```bash
ast-grep scan --rule test_rule.yml test_example.js
```

**Debugging if no matches:**

1. Simplify the rule (remove sub-rules)
2. Add `stopBy:
   end` to relational rules if not present
3. Use `--debug-query` to understand the AST structure (see below)
4. Check if `kind` values are correct for the language

### Step 5: Search the Codebase

Once the rule matches the example code correctly, search the actual codebase:

**For simple pattern searches:**

```bash
ast-grep run --pattern 'console.log($ARG)' --lang javascript /path/to/project
```

**For complex rule-based searches:**

```bash
ast-grep scan --rule my_rule.yml /path/to/project
```

**For inline rules (without creating files):**

```bash
ast-grep scan --inline-rules "id: my-rule
language: javascript
rule:
  pattern: \$PATTERN" /path/to/project
```

## ast-grep CLI Commands

### Inspect Code Structure (--debug-query)

Dump the AST structure to understand how code is parsed:

```bash
ast-grep run --pattern 'async function example() { await fetch(); }' \
  --lang javascript \
  --debug-query=cst
```

**Available formats:**

- `cst`:
  Concrete Syntax Tree (shows all nodes including punctuation)
- `ast`:
  Abstract Syntax Tree (shows only named nodes)
- `pattern`:
  Shows how ast-grep interprets your pattern

**Use this to:**

- Find the correct `kind` values for nodes
- Understand the structure of code you want to match
- Debug why patterns aren't matching

### Test Rules (scan with --stdin)

Test a rule against code snippet without creating files:

```bash
echo "const x = await fetch();" | ast-grep scan --inline-rules "id: test
language: javascript
rule:
  pattern: await \$EXPR" --stdin
```

### Search with Patterns (run)

Simple pattern-based search for single AST node matches:

```bash
ast-grep run --pattern 'console.log($ARG)' --lang javascript .
```

### Search with Rules (scan)

YAML rule-based search for complex structural queries:

```bash
ast-grep scan --rule my_rule.yml /path/to/project
```

## Tips for Writing Effective Rules

### Always Use stopBy: end

For relational rules, always use `stopBy:
end` unless there's a specific reason not to.

### Start Simple, Then Add Complexity

1. Try a `pattern` first
2. If that doesn't work, try `kind` to match the node type
3. Add relational rules (`has`, `inside`) as needed
4. Combine with composite rules (`all`, `any`, `not`) for complex logic

### Debug with AST Inspection

When rules don't match, use `--debug-query=cst` to see the actual AST structure.
